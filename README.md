## Predicting Credit Card Approvals

* First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
* We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
* We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
* After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
* Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
